Hello,

to compile the Direct3D DLL you'll need the Direct3D headers for Delphi.
You can get them here:
http://www.delphidev.de/header.php (Watch out, the website is in german...)

To run the samples you probably also need the Direct3D Dlls also available on this website.

I hope you'll get it compiled now...
