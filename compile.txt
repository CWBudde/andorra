This file will help you to get your version of Andorra compiled.

DirectX Plugin:
----------------
If you want to compile the file "AndorraDX93D.dll", you have to download the corresponding headers. You'll get them by downloading them from following page:

http://www.clootie.ru/

Note: If you use newer headers, you'll also need to download the new DirectX-DLL files. (d3dx9_xx.dll)

OpenGL Plugin:
--------------
The OpenGL Plugin is still missing.

Compressors and additional file formats:
----------------------------------------
If you want to use the AdPng.pas for highly compressed graphics, you'll need to download the PNG Delphi library (http://pngdelphi.sourceforge.net).
